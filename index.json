The main difference between the two is the data sources, i.e., Task 2A's claims are tweets, while Task 2B - debates and speeches. For solving the task, we combine variety of algorithms - BM25, S-BERT, a custom classifier, and RankSVM into a claim retrieval system.

There are many different forms of abusive language such as hate speech, profanity, and cyber-bullying, and online platforms seek to moderate it in order to limit societal harm, to comply with legislation, and to create a more inclusive environment for their users. Within the field of Natural Language Processing, researchers have developed different methods for automatically detecting abusive language, often focusing on specific subproblems or on narrow communities, as what is considered abusive language very much differs by context. We argue that there is currently a dichotomy between what types of abusive language online platforms seek to curb, and what research efforts there are to automatically detect abusive language. We thus survey existing methods as well as content moderation policies by online platforms in this light, and we suggest directions for future work.","tags":[],"title":"Detecting Abusive Language on Online Platforms: A Critical Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Momchil Hardalov","Todor Mihaylov","Dimitrina Zlatkova","Yoan Dinkov","Ivan Koychev","Preslav Nakov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604606810,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604606810,"objectID":"0d843fde8fe1b1fadee360fa80b7f757","permalink":"https://mhardalov.com/publication/exams/","publishdate":"2020-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/exams/","section":"publication","summary":"This work proposes EXAMS -- a new benchmark dataset for cross-lingual and multilingual question answering for high school examinations and performs various experiments with existing top-performing multilingual pre-trained models to show that EXAMS offers multiple challenges that require multilingual knowledge and reasoning in multiple domains.","tags":[],"title":"EXAMS: A Multi-Subject High School Examinations Dataset for Cross-Lingual and Multilingual Question Answering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Momchil Hardalov","Ivan Koychev","Preslav Nakov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588258801,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588258801,"objectID":"d597c3463548a0d02e18cfa29f595415","permalink":"https://mhardalov.com/publication/transformernlu/","publishdate":"2020-04-30T15:00:01Z","relpermalink":"/publication/transformernlu/","section":"publication","summary":"Detecting the user's intent and finding the corresponding slots among the utterance's words are important tasks in natural language understanding. Their interconnected nature makes their joint modeling a standard part of training such models. Moreover, data scarceness and specialized vocabularies pose additional challenges. Recently, the advances in pre-trained language models, namely contextualized models such as ELMo and BERT have revolutionized the field by tapping the potential of training very large models with just a few steps of fine-tuning on a task-specific dataset. Here, we leverage such models, namely BERT and RoBERTa, and we design a novel architecture on top of them. Moreover, we propose an intent pooling attention mechanism, and we reinforce the slot filling task by fusing intent distributions, word features, and token representations.

Despite those advances and the creation of more challenging datasets, most of the work is still done for English. Here, we study the effectiveness of multilingual BERT fine-tuned on large-scale English datasets for reading comprehension (e.g., for RACE), and we apply it to Bulgarian multiple-choice reading comprehension. We propose a new dataset containing 2,221 questions from matriculation exams for twelfth grade in various subjects ---history, biology, geography and philosophy---, and 412 additional questions from online quizzes in history. While the quiz authors gave no relevant context, we incorporate knowledge from Wikipedia, retrieving documents matching the combination of question + each answer option.

While those models are able to generate meaningful responses even in unseen situations, they need a lot of training data to build a reliable model. Thus, most real-world systems have used traditional approaches based on information retrieval (IR) and even hand-crafted rules, due to their robustness and effectiveness, especially for narrow-focused conversations. Here, we present a method that adapts a deep neural architecture from the domain of machine reading comprehension to re-rank the suggested answers from different models using the question as a context.

Still, in many cases, it might be feasible and even preferable to use simple information retrieval techniques. Thus, here we compare three different models: (i) a retrieval model, (ii) a sequence-to-sequence model with attention, and (iii) Transformer.
